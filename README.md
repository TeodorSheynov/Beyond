# Beyond :milky_way:
Softuni Project <br/>
https://beyondflights.azurewebsites.net/ <br/>

The site is about ticket sales for space travel . 👽

There is master account that gives some options to create update information.

user: `admin@admin.com` <br/>
password: admin123456 <br/>

Still not implemented :
- [ ] Payment
- [ ] External logins
- [ ] Table with ongoing flights.

If the site is down it could be because of the free azure hosting and exceeded quota. 😟
